First test game for my game development library of useful classes.
Just a classic game type with some minor animation polish. Made mostly to get back into the swing of things with game making.
Most of the issues here came with class organisation - how should scenes be drawn, how should transitions work, etc.
Slightly harder, since I worked assuming a single main-loop entry, rather than basic linear programming. This should make it exportable to web using emscripten, in theory.

Should be easy to play and test!
